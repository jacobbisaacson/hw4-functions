//What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
	// PARAMETER is the input into the function, which can change the behavior of the function
	// const functionName = (PARAMETER) => { some code that will work with the parameter }
	// ARGUMENT is when you call a function and tell it what the va;ue will be for its parameter, 
	// so giving the function an argument.  PASSING in an argument and CALLING a function
	// functionName(ARGUMENT)
//Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
	// console log is more to help ourselves learn what will acutally happen with our code, so we can see our progress,
	//and make sure everythigs working coreclty
	// return is what WILL actually happen. it also ends the function.
